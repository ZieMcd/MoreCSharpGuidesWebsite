    Hello, and welcome to my website. <br>
    <MudText Class="mt-3" Typo="Typo.h5">About the Website</MudText>
    This website is mainly away for to write some guides on C# related things. For the mean time the website is pretty simple but that could change 
    in future. 
    <MudText Class="mt-3" Typo="Typo.h5">About Me</MudText>
    I am fullstack C# developer but perfer to work in back end, so sorry if the website does not look that great. I only have 2 years
