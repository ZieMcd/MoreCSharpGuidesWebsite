        There times as developer that you want to run code periodically. There are few ways todo this in C#. There are two 
        popular libraries, <MudLink Href="https://www.quartz-scheduler.net/" Target="_blank">Quartz</MudLink> and 
        <MudLink Href="https://www.hangfire.io/" Target="_blank">Hangfire</MudLink> that allow you schedule jobs. Both of these
        libraries suffer from the same problem. Say if you two jobs (the code you want to run periodically) each in there own library. 
        Either you Hangfire or Quartz project has to reference both of those libraries.
